# Building APIs with AppSync

This is the sample demo project created with AWS Amplify CLI to demonstrate creation of GraphQL APIs with AppSync and authentication and authorization with Amazon Cognito and storage of multi-media files on AWS S3 with records on Amazon DynamoDB.

The workshop uses ReactJS with Amplify UI components for easier integration with services like Amazon Cognito. And Amplify SDK apis for an abstracted usage of differnt Serverless services.

The sample walkthrough is based on the AWS Workshop - https://appsync-immersionday.workshop.aws/
